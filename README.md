# Descrambler
An iOS app for solving Boggle boards!

## Installation
Download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/descrambler/id789589023?mt=8) on iPhone or iPad, or clone this repo to take a look at the source.

This project uses [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, but I have [included the pods with the repo](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control).

## Development
I'm not doing a ton of active development on this app, but feel free to send a pull request. There are definitely features that could be added!

## Known issues
- There are some [layout issues](https://github.com/eeevanbbb/Descrambler/blob/master/Descrambler/TileView.swift#L194) on devices (like iPads) where the keyboard covers some of the tiles.
